                    to `multi-host`, which creates a separate ingress, or OpenShift
                    routes, for every required endpoint. `single-host` makes Che exposed
                    on a single host name with workspaces exposed on subpaths. Read
                    the docs to learn about the limitations of this approach. Also

                    how the Operator and the Che server make that happen on Kubernetes.
