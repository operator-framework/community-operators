                more detail about the pod's status. There are five possible phase
                values: \n Pending: The pod has been accepted by the Kubernetes system,
                but one or more of the container images has not been created. This
                includes time before being scheduled as well as time spent downloading
                images over the network, which could take a while. Running: The pod
                has been bound to a node, and all of the containers have been created.
                At least one container is still running, or is in the process of starting
                or restarting. Succeeded: All containers in the pod have terminated
                in success, and will not be restarted. Failed: All containers in the
                pod have terminated, and at least one container has terminated in
                failure. The container either exited with non-zero status or was terminated
                by the system. Unknown: For some reason the state of the pod could
                not be obtained, typically due to an error in communicating with the
                host of the pod. \n More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#pod-phase"
