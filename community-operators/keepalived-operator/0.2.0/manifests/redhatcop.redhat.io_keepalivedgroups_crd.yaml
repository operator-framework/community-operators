                description: "Condition represents an observation of an object's state.
                  Conditions are an extension mechanism intended to be used when the
                  details of an observation are not a priori known or would not apply
                  to all instances of a given Kind. \n Conditions should be added
                  to explicitly convey properties that users and components care about
                  rather than requiring those properties to be inferred from other
                  observations. Once defined, the meaning of a Condition can not be
                  changed arbitrarily - it becomes part of the API, and has the same
                  backwards- and forwards-compatibility concerns of any other part
                  of the API."
