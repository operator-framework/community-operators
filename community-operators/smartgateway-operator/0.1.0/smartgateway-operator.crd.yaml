            prefetch:
              description: Number of messages that we can prefetch from AMQP 1.x. By enabling prefetching, the smart gateway won't need to
                request every message individually from the AMQP bus, resulting in a round trip for every request between sender and receiver.
                To avoid the round trip for every message, the use of prefetch can be used to allow the receiver to request messages be sent
                in anticipation of them being sent to us.
