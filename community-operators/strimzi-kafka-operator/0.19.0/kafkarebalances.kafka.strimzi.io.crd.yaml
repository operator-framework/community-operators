                for generating and executing the rebalance proposal. The supported
                goals are available at https://github.com/linkedin/cruise-control#goals.
                If an empty goals list is provided, the goals declared in the default.goals

                will be parsed by the java.util.regex.Pattern class; for more information
                on the supported formar consult the documentation for that class.
