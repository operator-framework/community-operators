## PR Continuous Integration

Operators submitted to this repo are automatically tested on a Kubernetes cluster before being merged. The Kubernetes distribution used for testing depends on which directory the operator is submitted to. Ideally all tests should pass before merging.

### CI test scripts

Operators are tested using several scripts found in the [`scripts/ci/`][scripts-ci] directory. When a PR is updated or modified, the CI configuration calls `scripts/ci/test-pr`, which calls `scripts/ci/test-operator` and `scripts/ci/verify-operator` for each operator updated in a PR that meets directory requirements for that CI environment. `test-operator` has two main functions: deploy an operator on the cluster using the [OLM][olm], and test the operator using the [scorecard][sdk-scorecard]. `verify-operator` runs [`operator-courier verify`][courier-verify] on an operators' [bundle][registry-bundle].

**Note**: CI test results do not explicitly prevent your operator from being merged _yet_. Test results will be used by PR reviewers to suggest changes before submission.

#### OLM

Deployment with the OLM involves creating several required manifest files to create `CustomResourceDefinitions` (CRD's) and the operators' `Deployment` using its `ClusterServiceVersion` (CSV) in-cluster. `test-operator` will create a [`operator-registry`][registry] Docker image containing the operators' bundled manifests, and `CatalogSource` and `Subscription` manifests that allow the OLM to find the registry image and deploy a particular CSV from the registry, respectively.

Failure to successfully deploy an operator using the OLM results in test failure, as all operators are expected to be deployable in this manner.

#### Scorecard

The [Operator SDK scorecard][sdk-scorecard] suggests modifications applicable to an operator based on development best-practices. The scorecard runs static checks on operator manifests and runtime tests to ensure an operator is using cluster resources correctly. A Custom Resource (CR) is created by the scorecard for use in runtime tests, so [`alm-examples`][olm-alm-examples] must be populated.

The scorecard assigns points to each passing component of the scorecard. The total number of points is a function of several factors, ex. number of CRD's, but a weighted total percentage is calculated for the overall test run. It is possible to get a score of 100%, but operators are not expected to achieve this.

`test-operator` injects a scorecard proxy container and volume into an operators' CSV manifest before deployment; this is necessary to get API server logs, from which the scorecard determines runtime test results. These modifications are not persistent, as they're only needed for testing.

**Note**: no explicit number of points or percentage is necessary to achieve before merging _yet_. These are suggestions to improve your operator.

#### operator-courier

The [`operator-courier verify`][courier] command verifies that a set of files is valid and can be bundled and pushed to [quay.io][quay]. Read the [docs][courier-docs] for more information.

### Upstream operators

Operators submitted to the `upstream-community-operators/` directory are tested against a [`minikube`][minikube] instance deployed on a [Travis CI][travis-ci] environment. The OLM is installed locally in this case.

### OpenShift operators

Operators submitted to the `community-operators/` directory are tested against an OpenShift 4.0 cluster deployed on AWS using the [`ci-operator`][ci-operator].
