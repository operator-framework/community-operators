## PR Continuous Integration

Operators submitted to this repo are automatically tested on a Kubernetes cluster before being merged. The Kubernetes distribution used for testing depends on which directory the operator is submitted to. Ideally all tests should pass before merging.

You can test operators locally using [following](https://github.com/redhat-operator-ecosystem/operator-test-playbooks/doc/upstream/users/README.md)
 documentation.

### CI test scripts

Test scripts are written in Ansible and located [here](https://github.com/redhat-operator-ecosystem/operator-test-playbooks/).

There are 3 test types. List of tests are shown in the following table.

|Test type|Description|
|:--------|:----------|
|kiwi|Full operator test|
|lemon|Full test of operator to be deployed from scratch|
|orange|Full test of operator to be deployed with existing bundles in quay registry|
|all|kiwi,lemon,orange|

#### kiwi - full operator test
* linting
* checking operator format
* scorecard
* temporary deploy single operator on Kind cluster

#### lemon
Test if deploy is possible from the scratch. I means creating bundle images and index image.

#### orange
Test if release pipeline can handle current operator configuration before release is triggered.

#### OLM

Deployment with the OLM involves creating several required manifest files to create `CustomResourceDefinitions` (CRD's) and the operators' `Deployment` using its `ClusterServiceVersion` (CSV) in-cluster. `test-operator` will create a [`operator-registry`][registry] Docker image containing the operators' bundled manifests, and `CatalogSource` and `Subscription` manifests that allow the OLM to find the registry image and deploy a particular CSV from the registry, respectively.

Failure to successfully deploy an operator using the OLM results in test failure, as all operators are expected to be deployable in this manner.

#### Scorecard

The [Operator SDK scorecard][sdk-scorecard] suggests modifications applicable to an operator based on development best-practices. The scorecard runs static checks on operator manifests and runtime tests to ensure an operator is using cluster resources correctly. A Custom Resource (CR) is created by the scorecard for use in runtime tests, so [`alm-examples`][olm-alm-examples] must be populated.

The scorecard utility runs through multiple test scenarios, some of which are required and others are optional. Currently the tests are configured like this.

**Mandatory tests that need to pass for the PR to be accepted:**

- `checkspectest` - verifies that the CRs have a `spec` section

- `writingintocrshaseffecttest` - verifies that writing into the CR causes the Operator to issue requests against the Kubernetes API server

**Recommended tests that should pass in order to have a well-behaved operator:**

- `checkstatustest` - verifies whether the CRs `status` block gets updated by the Operator to indicate reconciliation.

See the [scorecard test documentation][scorecard-test-docs] for more information.

`test-operator` injects a scorecard proxy container and volume into an operators' CSV manifest before deployment; this is necessary to get API server logs, from which the scorecard determines runtime test results. These modifications are not persistent, as they're only needed for testing.

**Note**: no explicit number of points or percentage is necessary to achieve before merging _yet_. These are suggestions to improve your operator.

#### operator-courier

The [`operator-courier verify`][courier] command verifies that a set of files is valid and can be bundled and pushed to [quay.io][quay]. Read the [docs][courier-docs] for more information.

### Upstream operators

Operators submitted to the `upstream-community-operators/` directory are tested against a [`KIND`][kind] instance deployed on a [Travis CI][travis-ci] environment. The OLM is installed locally in this case.

### OpenShift operators

Operators submitted to the `community-operators/` directory are tested against an OpenShift 4.0 cluster deployed on AWS using the [`ci-operator`][ci-operator].
