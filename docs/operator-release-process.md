## Operator is published
After this process, your operator will be published.

### Index image location

For Openshift: 

`registry.redhat.io/redhat/community-operator-index:v4.6`
`registry.redhat.io/redhat/community-operator-index:v4.7`
`registry.redhat.io/redhat/community-operator-index:latest` - this is a clone of `v4.6` from historical reasons as it always was a clone of `v4.6`. Will be deprecated in the future.

For Kubernetes:

`quay.io/operatorhubio/catalog:latest`

### Bundle images location
For Openshift:

`quay.io/openshift-community-operators/`

For Kubernetes:

`quay.io/operatorhubio/`
