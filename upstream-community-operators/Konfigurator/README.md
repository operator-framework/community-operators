## Deploying to Kubernetes

Deploying Konfigurator requires:

1. Deploying CRD to your cluster
2. Deploying Konfigurator operator

You can deploy the CRD and operator on your kubernetes cluster via any of the following methods.

### Vanilla Manifests

You can apply vanilla manifests by running the following command

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stakater/Konfigurator/master/deployments/kubernetes/konfigurator.yaml
```

Konfigurator by default looks for **KonfiguratorTemplate** only in the namespace where it is deployed, but it can be managed to work globally, you would have to change the `WATCH_NAMESPACE` environment variable to "" in the above manifest. e.g. change `WATCH_NAMESPACE` section to:

```yaml
            - name: WATCH_NAMESPACE
              value: ""
```

### Helm Charts

Alternatively if you have configured helm on your cluster, you can add konfigurator to helm from our public chart repository and deploy it via helm using below mentioned commands

```bash
helm repo add stakater https://stakater.github.io/stakater-charts

helm repo update

helm install stakater/konfigurator
```

Once Konfigurator is running, you can start creating resources supported by it. For details about its custom resources, look [here](https://github.com/stakater/Konfigurator/tree/master/docs/konfigurator-template.md).

To make Konfigurator work globally, you would have to change the `WATCH_NAMESPACE` environment variable to "" in values.yaml. e.g. change `WWATCH_NAMESPACE` section to:

```yaml
  env:
  - name: WATCH_NAMESPACE
    value: ""
```
