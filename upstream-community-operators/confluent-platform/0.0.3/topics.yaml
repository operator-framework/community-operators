    # This configuration controls how frequently the log compactor will attempt to clean the log (assuming log compaction is enabled).

    # This ratio bounds the maximum space wasted in the log by duplicates (at 50% at most 50% of the log could be duplicates).
    # A higher ratio will mean fewer, more efficient cleanings but will mean more wasted space in the log.
    # If the max.compaction.lag.ms or the min.compaction.lag.ms configurations are also specified,
    # then the log compactor considers the log to be eligible for compaction as soon as either: (i) the dirty ratio threshold
    # has been met and the log has had dirty (uncompacted) records for at least the min.compaction.lag.ms duration,

    # then the producer will raise an exception (either NotEnoughReplicas or NotEnoughReplicasAfterAppend).
    # When used together, min.insync.replicas and acks allow you to enforce greater durability guarantees.
    # A typical scenario would be to create a topic with a replication factor of 3, set min.insync.replicas to 2,
    # and produce with acks of "all". This will ensure that the producer raises an exception if a majority
    # of replicas do not receive a write.
