                            Service, it can not be used at the same time as externalTrafficPolicy=Local.
                            Topology keys must be valid label keys and at most 16
                            keys may be specified. Endpoints are chosen based on the
                            first topology key with available backends. If this field
                            is specified and all entries have no backends that match

                            ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer. "ClusterIP" allocates
                            a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing to endpoints.
                            Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is
                            not specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints
                            object or EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is "None",
                            no virtual IP is allocated and the endpoints are published
                            as a set of endpoints rather than a virtual IP. "NodePort"
                            builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node
                            which routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP. "LoadBalancer"
                            builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                            (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the
                            same endpoints as the clusterIP. "ExternalName" aliases
                            this service to the specified externalName. Several other
                            fields do not apply to ExternalName services. More info:
