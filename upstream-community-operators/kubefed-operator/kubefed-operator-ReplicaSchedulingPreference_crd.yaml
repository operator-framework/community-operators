              description: TODO (@irfanurrehman); upgrade this to label selector only
                if need be. The idea of this API is to have a a set of preferences
                which can be used for a target FederatedDeployment or FederatedReplicaset.
                Although the set of preferences in question can be applied to multiple
                target objects using label selectors, but there are no clear advantages
                of doing that as of now. To keep the implementation and usage simple,
                matching ns/name of RSP resource to the target resource is sufficient
                and only additional information needed in RSP resource is a target
                kind (FederatedDeployment or FederatedReplicaset).
