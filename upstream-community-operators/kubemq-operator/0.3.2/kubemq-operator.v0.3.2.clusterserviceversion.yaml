      ## What is KubeMQ?
      Enterprise-grade message queue broker native for Kubernetes. Delivered in a production-ready cluster, and designed for any type of workload.
      KubeMQ is provided as a small, lightweight Docker container, designed for any workload and architecture running in Kubernetes or any other container orchestration system which support Docker.

      ## Main Features
      - All-batteries included Messaging Broker for Kubernetes environment
      - Blazing fast (written in Go), small and lightweight Docker container
      - Asynchronous and Synchronous messaging with support for  `Exactly One Delivery`, `At Most Once Delivery` and `At Least Once Delivery` models
      - Supports durable FIFO based Queue, Publish-Subscribe Events, Publish-Subscribe with Persistence (Events Store), RPC Command and Query messaging patterns
      - Supports gRPC, Rest and WebSocket Transport protocols with TLS support (both RPC and Stream modes)
      - Authentication and authorisation
      - No Message broker configuration needed (i.e., queues, exchanges)
      - Built-in Caching, Metrics, and Tracing
      - .Net, Java, Python, Go and NodeJS SDKs

      ## Messaging Patterns

      ### Queues
      KubeMQ supports distributed durable FIFO based queues with the following core features:

      - **Exactly One Delivery** - Only one message guarantee will deliver to the subscriber
      - **Single and Batch Messages Send and Receive** - Single and multiple messages in one call
      - **Multicast and routing** - sending to multiple sources in one command
      - **RPC and Stream Flows** - RPC flow allows an insert and pull messages in one call. Stream flow allows single message consuming in transactional way
      - **Message Policy** - Each message can be configured with expiration and delay timers. In addition, each message can specify a dead-letter queue for un-processed messages attempts
      - **Long Polling** - Consumers can wait until a message available in the queue to consume
      - **Peak Messages** - Consumers can peek into a queue without removing them from the queue
      - **Ack All Queue Messages** - Any client can mark all the messages in a queue as discarded and will not be available anymore to consume
      - **Visibility timers** - Consumers can pull a message from the queue and set a timer which will cause the message not be visible to other consumers. This timer can be extended as needed.
      - **Resend Messages** - Consumers can send back a message they pulled to a new queue or send a modified message to the same queue for further processing.

      ### Pub/Sub

      KubeMQ supports Publish-Subscribe (a.k.a Pub/Sub) messages patterns with the following core features:

      - **Events** -  An asynchronous real-time Pub/Sub pattern.
      - **Events Store** -An asynchronous Pub/Sub pattern with persistence.
      - **Grouping** - Load balancing of events between subscribers
      - **Multicast and routing** - sending to multiple sources in one command

      ### RPC
      KubeMQ supports CQRS based RPC flows with the following core features:

      - **Commands** -  A synchronous two ways Command pattern for CQRS types of system architecture.
      - **Query** - A synchronous two ways Query pattern for CQRS types of system architecture.
      - **Response** - An answer for a Query type RPC call
      - **Timeout** - Timeout interval is set for each RPC call. Once no response is received within the Timeout interval, RPC call return an error
      - **Grouping** - Load balancing of RPC calls between receivers
      - **Caching** - RPC response can be cached for future requests without the need to process again by a receiver

      ## Interfaces
      - **gRPC** - High performance RPC and streaming framework that can run in any environment, Open source and Cloud Native.
      - **Rest** - Restful Api with WebSocket support for bi-directional streaming.

      ## SDK
      - **C#** - C# SDK based on gRPC
      - **Java** - Java SDK based on gRPC
      - **Go** - Go SDK based on gRPC
      - **Python** - Python SDK based on gRPC
      - **cURL** - cURL SDK based on Rest
      - **Node** - Node SDK based on gRPC and Rest
      - **PHP** - PHP SDK based on Rest
      - **Ruby** - Ruby SDK based on Rest
      - **jQuery** jQuery SDK based Rest

      ## Observability
      - **Metrics** - Metrics can be exported to variety of Backends
