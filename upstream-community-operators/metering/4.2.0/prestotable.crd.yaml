        PrestoTable is a custom resource that represents a database table accessible from within Presto.
        When a PrestoTable resource is created, the reporting-operator creates a table within Presto according
        to the configuration provided, or exposes an existing table.

              description: |
                Unmanaged indicates whether a PrestoTable resource is referencing an existing table,
                and if set to true, the operator should not attempt to create or manage that table within Presto.

              type: string
              description: |
                Catalog specifies which catalog the Presto table is to be created within.
                In many cases, the catalog will be set to "hive".

                The schema within the Presto catalog for the table to created in,
                or the schema the table should exist in if unmanaged.
                If the catalog is `hive` then there will always be at least the `default` schema.

                TableName is the desired name of the table to be created in Presto,
                or in the case where "unmanaged" is set to false, the name of an existing table within Presto.

                A list of columns that match the schema of the PrestoTable.
                For each list item, you must specify a `name` field, which is the name of an individual column for the Presto table,
                and a `type` field, which corresponds to a valid type in Presto.

                Properties is a map containing string key and value pairs. Each key-value pair is a table property for
                configuring the table. The available properties depend on the "catalog" being used.

                Sets a comment on the Presto table. Comments are just arbitrary strings that have no meaning to Presto,
                but can be used to store arbitrary information about a table.

                View controls whether the reporting-operator needs to create a view within Presto.
                If true, the reporting-operator uses the "query" field as the SELECT statement for creating the view.
