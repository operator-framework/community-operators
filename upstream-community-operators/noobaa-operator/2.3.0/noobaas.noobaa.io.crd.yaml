                      field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                      For example, if the object reference is to a container within
                      a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}"
                      (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                      the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]"
                      (container with index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen
                      only to have some well-defined way of referencing a part of
                      an object. TODO: this design is not final and this field is
                      subject to change in the future.'
