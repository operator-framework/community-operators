      description: ApplicationSnapshot is an internal resource, created by Operator.
        It includes all Application metadata (such as Deployment, StatefulSet, ConfigMap,
        PersistentVolumeClaim, and other Kubernetes resources) and Snapshots of Data,
        stored on VPSA. When ApplicationSnapshot is created, Operator creates snapshots
        of VPSA Volumes, and stores serialized Kubernetes resources in the ApplicationSnapshot.
        ApplicationSnapshot can appear only in one CloneConfiguration at the same
        time (User can't clone the same ApplicationSnapshot twice).
